# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for rewriting the Orbiton dashboard project to create a more developer-friendly plugin system. The goal is to simplify plugin development, improve the developer experience, and make the project more accessible through better distribution methods. The rewrite will focus on creating a clean plugin API, comprehensive documentation, and streamlined development workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Simplified Plugin Development API

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want a simple and intuitive API to create widgets, so that I can focus on my plugin's functionality rather than complex integration details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer creates a new plugin THEN the system SHALL provide a simple base class or interface that handles common widget lifecycle
2. WHEN a developer implements a plugin THEN they SHALL only need to implement core methods like render(), update(), and configure()
3. WHEN a plugin is created THEN the system SHALL automatically handle grid positioning, theming, and event management
4. IF a plugin needs custom styling THEN the system SHALL provide a simple theme API
5. WHEN a plugin throws an error THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle it without crashing the entire dashboard

### Requirement 2: Plugin Discovery and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily discover, install, and manage plugins, so that I can customize my dashboard without manual file management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to install a plugin THEN the system SHALL support installation via npm packages
2. WHEN a user runs a discovery command THEN the system SHALL list available plugins from npm registry
3. WHEN a user installs a plugin THEN the system SHALL automatically register it in the configuration
4. WHEN a user wants to remove a plugin THEN the system SHALL provide a clean uninstall process
5. IF a plugin has dependencies THEN the system SHALL handle dependency resolution automatically

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Configuration System

**User Story:** As a user, I want a flexible configuration system that supports validation and auto-completion, so that I can easily customize my dashboard setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a configuration THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration against plugin schemas
2. WHEN a user edits configuration THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages for invalid values
3. WHEN a plugin defines options THEN the system SHALL automatically generate configuration documentation
4. IF a configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on how to fix it
5. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate all plugin configurations before loading

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Developer Documentation

**User Story:** As a new plugin developer, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can quickly understand how to create effective plugins.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer visits the documentation THEN they SHALL find a complete plugin development guide
2. WHEN a developer needs examples THEN the system SHALL provide multiple plugin templates for common use cases
3. WHEN a developer wants to test their plugin THEN the documentation SHALL include testing guidelines and tools
4. IF a developer encounters issues THEN the documentation SHALL include troubleshooting guides
5. WHEN the API changes THEN the documentation SHALL be automatically updated to reflect changes

### Requirement 5: Improved Distribution and Installation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily install and use Orbiton through standard package managers, so that I don't need to manually clone and build the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to install Orbiton THEN they SHALL be able to install it globally via npm
2. WHEN Orbiton is installed THEN it SHALL be available as a global command
3. WHEN a user runs the installation THEN all dependencies SHALL be automatically resolved
4. IF a user wants to develop locally THEN they SHALL be able to clone and run the project easily
5. WHEN updates are available THEN users SHALL be able to update via standard npm update commands

### Requirement 6: Plugin Development Tools

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want development tools that help me create, test, and debug plugins efficiently, so that I can iterate quickly on my plugin ideas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer creates a new plugin THEN the system SHALL provide a plugin generator/scaffolding tool
2. WHEN a developer tests their plugin THEN the system SHALL provide a development mode with hot reloading
3. WHEN a plugin has errors THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and stack traces
4. IF a developer wants to debug THEN the system SHALL support debugging tools and logging
5. WHEN a plugin is ready for distribution THEN the system SHALL provide packaging and publishing tools

### Requirement 7: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want my current plugins and configurations to continue working after the rewrite, so that I don't lose my customizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new system starts THEN it SHALL detect and migrate existing .orbitonrc.json configurations
2. WHEN existing plugins are found THEN the system SHALL provide migration guidance or automatic conversion
3. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and manual migration steps
4. WHEN users upgrade THEN they SHALL receive notifications about breaking changes and migration paths
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN users SHALL be able to use both old and new plugin formats during a transition period

### Requirement 8: Zero Configuration with Deep Customization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to work perfectly out of the box without any configuration, but still allow me to customize every aspect when I need to, so that I can get started immediately while maintaining full control over my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first runs Orbiton THEN the system SHALL automatically display a sensible default dashboard without requiring any configuration file
2. WHEN no configuration exists THEN the system SHALL intelligently detect the user's environment and select appropriate default plugins
3. WHEN a user wants to customize THEN the system SHALL provide progressive configuration options from simple to advanced
4. IF a user makes any customization THEN the system SHALL preserve their choices while keeping unconfigured aspects at smart defaults
5. WHEN the system detects new capabilities (like Docker, Git repos, etc.) THEN it SHALL suggest relevant plugins automatically
6. WHEN a user runs Orbiton in different contexts (development machine, server, etc.) THEN the system SHALL adapt the default plugin selection accordingly
7. IF a user wants full control THEN they SHALL be able to override any default behavior through configuration
8. WHEN a user resets configuration THEN the system SHALL return to intelligent defaults rather than empty state

### Requirement 9: AI-Friendly Development Experience

**User Story:** As a developer using AI coding assistants (Cursor, Kiro, Claude, etc.), I want the project to be optimized for AI-assisted development, so that AI tools can effectively help me create and maintain plugins.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI assistant analyzes the project THEN it SHALL find clear configuration files that describe the project structure and conventions
2. WHEN an AI needs to understand plugin development THEN the system SHALL provide machine-readable schemas and examples
3. WHEN an AI generates plugin code THEN the system SHALL have TypeScript definitions and JSDoc comments for all APIs
4. IF an AI assistant needs project context THEN configuration files SHALL include comprehensive metadata about coding patterns and conventions
5. WHEN an AI creates new plugins THEN the system SHALL provide template files and scaffolding that follow consistent patterns
6. WHEN an AI modifies existing code THEN the system SHALL have clear separation of concerns and well-documented interfaces
7. IF an AI needs to understand dependencies THEN package.json and configuration files SHALL clearly document all relationships
8. WHEN an AI generates tests THEN the system SHALL provide testing utilities and patterns that are easy to replicate

### Requirement 10: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to be responsive and efficient with system resources, so that it doesn't impact my system's performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN plugins update data THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage update intervals to prevent excessive resource usage
2. WHEN multiple plugins are active THEN the system SHALL optimize rendering to maintain smooth performance
3. IF a plugin becomes unresponsive THEN the system SHALL isolate it to prevent affecting other plugins
4. WHEN the dashboard starts THEN it SHALL load plugins asynchronously to reduce startup time
5. WHEN plugins are not visible THEN the system SHALL pause unnecessary updates to save resources
